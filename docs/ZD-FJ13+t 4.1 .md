## 4.1 
4.1.1. Main Structure of Unwinding Component
Unwinding component is mainly constituted by unwinding machine frame (Figure 2-4), unwinding arms (Figure 2-5, 2-7), tension control system and electric control system.
4.1.2. Operation of Unwinding Component
4.1.2.1. Function Description for Unwinding Operating Paneln of onwinding Operating Panel
1. Automatic Tension Controller Panel: refer to Operation Manual of AXTEC Automatic Tension Controller for details of adjustment.
2. Operating Side Folding Button: for folding of unwinding arm on operating side.
3. Material Frame Jointly Folding Button: for folding of unwinding arms both on operating side and transmission side at the same time.
4. Material Frame Jointly Unfolding Button: for unfolding of unwinding arms both on operating side and transmission side at the same time.
5. Operating Side Unfolding Button: for unfolding of unwinding arm on operating side.
6. Stop Button: used to stop the machine in course of normal operation; and the caution lamp will turn to red from green.
7. Emergency Stop Button: hit this button to make machine scram; at this moment any buttons
will be invalid. To reset the machine back to normal state, it is necessary to pull out this button,
and press Reset Button on touch screen, then the machine can be operated normally.
8. Transmission Side Unfolding Button: for unfolding of unwinding arm on transmission side.
9. Function Selection Knob: for selecting the function of rising/falling or deviation rectification of unwinding arm.
10. Material Frame Rising/Falling Knob: for selecting the function of rising or falling of
unwinding arm.
11. Transmission Side Folding Button: for folding of unwinding arm on transmission side.
4.1.2.2. Loading and Unloading of Material Reel
a) It is appropriate to adjust the unwinding arms on operating side and transmission side properly when new reel is being installed for the first time, so as to make these two arms symmetrical with the center of unwinding frame. Ensure that the material reel can be in the middle of the machine after installation.
b) Press Material Frame Jointly Unfolding Button according to the width of material reel (Figure 3-4), to adjust the unwinding arms to the positions where the material pushing cone head is slightly wider than the material reel core.
c) Measure the distance from the center of material reel to be installed to the ground; press Material Frame Rising/Falling Knob (Figure 3-10) to make the height of the material pushing cone head of unwinding arm from the ground be the distance measured.
d) Press Material Frame Jointly Folding Button (Figure 3-3) on the operating panel to make the material pushing cone head push tightly the material reel core.
e) Make the material pass through the machine according to Material Feeding Diagram in Chapter 9; then bags can be produced normally if other components are also ready for production.
f) When the material reel is fully used up, stop the machine and press Material Frame Jointly
Unfolding Button (Figure 3-4) on the operating panel to make the material pushing cone head quit from the material reel core.
Note:
In course of adjusting unwinding arms and loading/unloading material reel, the operation can be done only after ensuring that there are no personnel or articles in the moving range.
When there is loose edge or tight edge of material on the dancer roller (Figure 4-3), the difference can be adjusted via the following specific operation procedure: first loosen locking handle (Figure 4-1); then turn eccentric shaft (Figure 4-2) to the appropriate position and finally fasten locking handle after adjustment (Figure 4-1).
4.1.2.4. Tension Adjustment of Material Reel
Refer to Operation Manual of AXTEC Automatic Tension Controller for details.
4.1.2.5. Deviation Rectification Adjustment of material roll.
Refer to Operation Manual of AIBO EPC System for details.
