#### 4.1.2.2. Loading and Unloading of Material Reel

(A) It is appropriate to adjust the unwinding arms on operating side and transmission side properly when new reel is being installed for the first time, so as to make these two arms symmetrical with the center of unwinding frame. Ensure that the material reel can be in the middle of the machine after installation.
(B) Press Material Frame Jointly Unfolding Button according to the width of material reel (Figure 3-4), to adjust the unwinding arms to the positions where the material pushing cone head is slightly wider than the material reel core.
(C) Measure the distance from the center of material reel to be installed to the ground; press Material Frame Rising/Falling Knob (Figure 3-10) to make the height of the material pushing cone head of unwinding arm from the ground be the distance measured.
(D) Press Material Frame Jointly Folding Button (Figure 3-3) on the operating panel to make the material pushing cone head push tightly the material reel core.
(E) Make the material pass through the machine according to Material Feeding Diagram in Chapter 9; then bags can be produced normally if other components are also ready for production.
(F) When the material reel is fully used up, stop the machine and press Material Frame Jointly
Unfolding Button (Figure 3-4) on the operating panel to make the material pushing cone head quit from the material reel core.

Note:

In course of adjusting unwinding arms and loading/unloading material reel, the operation can be done only after ensuring that there are no personnel or articles in the moving range.

#### 4.3.2. Operation of Side Gluing Component

This machine adopts glue transfer method for side gluing (Figure 5). Glue transfer pulley dips into the side glue plate (Figure 5-6). The surplus glue is scrapped by side glue scrapper (Figure 5-7). then the remaining glue is transferred onto gluing pulley (Figure 5-1) and then transferred onto raw paper. The driving operation is made by driving gear for side gluing (Figure 5-8).

The separation and reunion between gluing pulley (Figure 5-1) and raw paper are controlled by clutch cylinder (Figure 5-5).

The gluing position of gluing pulley (Figure 5-1) on raw paper can be adjusted by adjusting hand wheel (Figure 5-4).

Note:

(A) Avoid overfilling glue into side glue plate; the height of glue level should not exceed 2/3 of the height of glue plate.

(B) It is necessary to wash the side gluing components in case of getting off work or out of service for long time. First dismantle glue transfer pulley and side glue scrapper to wash; then wash gluing pulley on the machine; finally dismantle side glue plate to pour out the remainder glue, wash and properly place it for next usage.

1. **Air Source Pressure Gauge:** for indicating air source pressure.
2. **Side Gluing Mode Selection Knob:** used to select a mode for side gluing (manually or automatically).
In manual operation mode, clutch cylinder acts to separate the gluing pulley and raw paper so that glue cannot be applied onto raw paper. This mode is mainly used for adjusting machine.
In automatic operation mode, clutch cylinder acts together with main machine. When main machine starts up, clutch cylinder acts to make the gluing pulley close to raw paper and glue can be applied onto raw paper, when main machine stops, clutch cylinder acts to separate gluing pulley from raw paper, so that glue cannot be applied onto raw paper. This mode is mainly used for normal operation of the machine.
The conversion between these two modes can be made at any time.
3. **Pressure Adjusting Knob:** for adjusting the pressure of air source.
