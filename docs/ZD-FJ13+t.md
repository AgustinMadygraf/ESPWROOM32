1. Automatic Tension Controller Panel: refer to Operation Manual of AXTEC Automatic Tension Controller for details of adjustment.
2. Operating Side Folding Button: for folding of unwinding arm on operating side.
3. Material Frame Jointly Folding Button: for folding of unwinding arms both on operating side and transmission side at the same time.
4. Material Frame Jointly Unfolding Button: for unfolding of unwinding arms both on operating side and transmission side at the same time.
5. Operating Side Unfolding Button: for unfolding of unwinding arm on operating side.
6. Stop Button: used to stop the machine in course of normal operation; and the caution lamp will turn to red from green.
7. Emergency Stop Button: hit this button to make machine scram; at this moment any buttons
will be invalid. To reset the machine back to normal state, it is necessary to pull out this button,
and press Reset Button on touch screen, then the machine can be operated normally.
8. Transmission Side Unfolding Button: for unfolding of unwinding arm on transmission side.
9. Function Selection Knob: for selecting the function of rising/falling or deviation rectification of unwinding arm.
10. Material Frame Rising/Falling Knob: for selecting the function of rising or falling of
unwinding arm.
11. Transmission Side Folding Button: for folding of unwinding arm on transmission side.
4.1.2.2. Loading and Unloading of Material Reel
a) It is appropriate to adjust the unwinding arms on operating side and transmission side properly when new reel is being installed for the first time, so as to make these two arms symmetrical with the center of unwinding frame. Ensure that the material reel can be in the middle of the machine after installation.
b) Press Material Frame Jointly Unfolding Button according to the width of material reel (Figure 3-4), to adjust the unwinding arms to the positions where the material pushing cone head is slightly wider than the material reel core.
c) Measure the distance from the center of material reel to be installed to the ground; press Material Frame Rising/Falling Knob (Figure 3-10) to make the height of the material pushing cone head of unwinding arm from the ground be the distance measured.
d) Press Material Frame Jointly Folding Button (Figure 3-3) on the operating panel to make the material pushing cone head push tightly the material reel core.
e) Make the material pass through the machine according to Material Feeding Diagram in Chapter 9; then bags can be produced normally if other components are also ready for production.
f) When the material reel is fully used up, stop the machine and press Material Frame Jointly
Unfolding Button (Figure 3-4) on the operating panel to make the material pushing cone head quit from the material reel core.
Note:
In course of adjusting unwinding arms and loading/unloading material reel, the operation can be done only after ensuring that there are no personnel or articles in the moving range.
When there is loose edge or tight edge of material on the dancer roller (Figure 4-3), the difference can be adjusted via the following specific operation procedure: first loosen locking handle (Figure 4-1); then turn eccentric shaft (Figure 4-2) to the appropriate position and finally fasten locking handle after adjustment (Figure 4-1).

## 4.4. Main Structure and Operation of Tube Forming Component

### 4.4.1 Main Structure of Tube Forming Component

Tube forming component is constituted by tube forming machine frame (Figure 7-4), forming mould component (Figure 7-7) and paper presing pulley component (Figure 7-1)

1. Paper Pressing Pulley Component
2. Forming Mould Component
3. Locking Screw
4. Tube Forming Machine Frame
5. Contrast Sensor
6. Mould Fixing Bar
7. Side Tucking Disc Component
8. Side Tucking Disc Adjusting Seat

### 4.4.2 Operation of Tube Forming Component

#### Operations of Tube Forming Moulds:
First select a pair of forming moulds of certain size according to the width of bags to be produced and install the forming moulds onto the center of the machine. Then loosen the locking screw (Figure 7-3) on Tube Forming Machine Frame (Figure 7-4), and adjust the position of the lower forming mould to be tangent to material traction pulley (Figure 8). Finally fasten the locking screw after the adjustment (Figure 7-3).

#### Operation of Side Tucking Discs:
According to the adjusted forming mould, adjust the height of side tucking discs (Figure 7-7) (6 groups in total) so as to make it to be the middle position between upper and lower moulds. There is one screw on the lower end of the adjusting seat (Figure 9) for adjusting of the height of side tucking discs. According to the size of bags to be produced, use the adjusting hand wheel on the adjusting seat for adjusting the insertion depth of side tucking discs. The discs will break the paper tube in case of being inserted too deep while make tube forming bad in case of being inserted too shallow. In course of adjusting side tucking discs, the locking nut on the front of adjusting seat (Figure 7-8) should not be locked too tight; otherwise the discs will be unable to be adjusted; the locking nut should not be locked too loose, otherwise the adjustment will be inaccurate. After adjustment fasten the locking nut so as to avoid position deviation due to looseness of nut in course of operation of the equipment.

#### Operation of Paper Pressing Pulleys:
The forming of large and small edges of paper tube is made by stress from paper pressing pulleys (Figure 10). The position of paper pressing pulley is different according to the sizes of different paper bags to be produced; the position of the paper pressing pulley can be adjusted at will by loosening the adjusting handle on the paper pressing pulley; the clump weight on the paper pressing pulley can be increased or decreased according to actual requirements.

#### Operation of Mould Fixing Bar:
When the central line of the paper tube is not identical to that of the machine after the paper tube is output from the forming mould, the forming mould can be fixed onto the central line of the machine, by adjusting the nut on the mould fixing bar (Figure 11).
